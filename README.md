3. This graph shows us not only how many riders but also the length of each ride by hour.  We can discern that bikesharing picks up in mid-afternoon to early evening and when is peak times for bike checkouts.

4.  This is a followup to the Checkout for Users but broken down by Gender.  Splitting them out helps us determine the quantity and types of bikes needed for particular times.

5.  This heatmap depicts that Bikesharing is used primarily between 6-9 a.m. and again from 4-8 p.m.  Saturday and Sunday see a good average for sharing also.  We could determine that if we need to make bike repairs a good time would be 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.
