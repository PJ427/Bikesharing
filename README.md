# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis:  

We are to build a business proposal detailing some of the benefits of Bikesharing.  This is a popular mode of transportaion to see the sights in New York City and it is beleived that our fair city of Des Moines, Iowa could benefit from such an endeavor.  Using data from Citibike, we giva a snapshot of some of the more important factors.

## Results:

1. It's important to note the number of Bikesharers just in the month of August.

3. This graph shows us not only how many riders but also the length of each ride by hour.  We can discern that bikesharing picks up in mid-afternoon to early evening and when is peak times for bike checkouts.

4.  This is a followup to the Checkout for Users but broken down by Gender.  Splitting them out helps us determine the quantity and types of bikes needed for particular times.

5.  This heatmap depicts that Bikesharing is used primarily between 6-9 a.m. and again from 4-8 p.m.  Saturday and Sunday see a good average for sharing also.  We could determine that if we need to make bike repairs a good time would be 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.

## Summary:

The information we gathered using the Citibike dataset must be taken lightly.  There are many differences between New York City and Des Moines and were just not talking population.  However, the information does paint a decent enough picture on the who and when.  From this we can make determinations on type of bikes needed, quantity, etc.  It also gives us the breakout on when bike maintenance should be conducted.

Another factor to consider would be the age of potential riders.  This information could be important in determing length of rides, types of bikes, and placement.  Below are two charts that depict the age group of customers and subscribers:
